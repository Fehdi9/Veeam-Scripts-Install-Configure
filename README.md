# Veeam-Scripts-Install-Configure

Proprietary application developed by Veeam, it is a very easy to implement solution allowing the backup of terminals with archiving and restoration features.
My goal was to configure Veeam Backup & Replication from a new installation of the software to meet the specifications.

After a long study of the Veeam B&R documentation, it accepts the PowerShell language and offers the possibility to automate tasks normally done by using a GUI.
Thus, I have provided a script responding to the customer request, it is able to implement the following features:

User creation;
Machine to be backed up;
Lists to which these machines belong; Backup job creations;
Definition of backup servers.
